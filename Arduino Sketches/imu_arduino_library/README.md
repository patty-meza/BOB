# Arduino driver for ICM-20948
Arduino library for i2c communication with the 9-DOF IMU from TDK, ICM-20948. All output data is given in SI-units and all sensor data is aligned with the acc/gyro-coordinate system (see [data sheet](http://www.invensense.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DS-000189-ICM-20948-v1.3.pdf)).

I have developed this library for my [ICM-20948 breakout board](https://github.com/dtornqvist/icm-20948-breakout).

## Note
The library is in beta phase and have not been tested thoroughly.

## Credits
The library is heavily inspired by the Bolder Flight [MPU-9250 library](https://github.com/bolderflight/MPU9250).
